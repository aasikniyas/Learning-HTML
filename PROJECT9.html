            For beginners, the thought of designing a website from scratch can seem like a really difficult task. Let’s
            ease it a little bit in this blog. The online market is expanding at a good rate and for most of us,
            websites form part of our daily life.
            <br>
            HTML, CSS, and JS are special web languages that work together as a framework to form the front-end design
            of a website by applying information that affects content, styling, and dynamically interacting with a site.
            A framework can be considered as a platform to develop applications. The framework may differ upon the type
            of software you are designing but in our case, this platform is provided to us by the combination of web
            languages mentioned above.

        <h1>Using HTML to display our content</h1>
        <p>

            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure the content inside the
            web pages. The content can contain anything like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.
            HTML doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality because it’s not a programming language.
            Instead, it just makes it possible to organize and format documents, the same way we do in Microsoft Word.
            When working with HTML, we use tags to mark up a web page. Let’s see an example below:
